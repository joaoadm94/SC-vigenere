HEC persuaded Blackmore to travel in from Hamburg to audition for the new group. 
He was making a name for himself as a studio session guitarist, 
and had also been a member of the Outlaws, Screaming Lord Sutch, and Neil Christian, 
the latter artist prompting Blackmore's move to Germany. Curtis's erratic behaviour and lifestyle, 
fuelled by his use of LSD, caused him to display a sudden lack of interest in the project he had started, 
forcing HEC to dismiss him from Roundabout. However, HEC was now intrigued with the possibilities Lord and 
Blackmore brought and persuaded Ritchie to return from Hamburg a second time. Lord and Blackmore began the 
recruitment of additional members, retaining Tony Edwards as their manager.[20] Lord convinced Nick Simper 
to join on bass, but Blackmore insisted they leave Carlo Little behind in favour of drummer Bobby Woodman.[18] 
Woodman was the former drummer for Vince Taylor's Play-Boys (for whom he had played under the name Bobbie Clarke). 
The initial line-up of Deep Purple started in Cadogan Gardens in South Kensington.
